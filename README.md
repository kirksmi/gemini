# Integrating genetic regulatory networks and genome-scale metabolic models using GEMINI and PROM
We have developed two genome-scale metabolic network algorithms that integrate the transcriptional regulatory network into genome-scale metabolic models. 

**PROM (Probabilistic Regulation of Metabolism)** enables the quantitative integration of regulatory and metabolic networks to build genome-scale integrated metabolic–regulatory models. **GEMINI (Gene Expression and Metabolism Integrated for Network Inference)** directly connects regulatory interactions to observable phenotypes and allows rapid assessment of inferred regulatory interactions using a metabolic network.
